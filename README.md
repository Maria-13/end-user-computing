Problem statement:

Solution:

App description: a habit tracker can help you track how well you're sticking with daily, weekly, or monthly habits.
Web application should be designed for the standard Desktop interface (i.e. not mobile).
Habit trackers are applications that allow you to set and track your habits---the good as well as the bad ones. Habit trackers either rely on self-reports or use data from sensors (FitBit, etc.). Many habit trackers are only available as native apps (Android, iOS). In this class project we focus on building a Web-based habit tracker application instead that relies on self- reports.
Created a habit-tracking application which uses a grid for each day of the year and let the user track how many days did they actually follow the habit.
