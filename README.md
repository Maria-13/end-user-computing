# Daily Habits: habit tracker
Problem statement:
New habits can improve the quality of our lives and sometimes can even transform our life experience. However, it can be challenging to maintain new habits for a long period of time. When we're trying to set new habits, we have to deal with a lot of resistance. To make this easier, we need a feedback loop. 

Solution: a habit tracker can help us track how well you're sticking with daily, weekly, or monthly habits. A tracking system that gives ourselves a cross/tick mark for each new habit weâ€™ve accomplished each day can help to build a system that we can rely on. Without any accountability, we increase the likelihood of forgetting about our new habits altogether. Having a tracking system helps us stay committed. Tracking your habits on a daily basis gives you a sense of everyday accomplishment.

App description: it's a web-based application that allows you to register and log in into the system; add new habits; track your habits in a calendar; edit/delete your habits. In Daily Habits tracker there is a grid for each day of the year that lets the user track how many days they actually follow their habits.
